<h5>A pot of chili</h5>
<h4>Description:</h4>
<p1>Yummy chili with veggies and stuff.</p1>
<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>2-3 spears of celery</li>
    <li>2 large carrots</li> 
    <li>2 bell peppers - whichever colors you prefer</li>
    <li>1 anaheim pepper</li>  
    <li>1 large sweet onion</li> 
    <li>1 jar spaghetti sauce.  I like garlic and onion flavors</li>
    <li>2 cans diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 cans red kidney beans</li>
    <li>1 can black beans</li>
    <li>1 can corn</li>
    <li>Chili powder</li>  
    <li>Cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>Garlic powder</li>
    <li>Grated cheese - cheddar or pepper jack work well</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Dice carrots, onion, peppers and celery.  I like them kind of chunky.  I remove the seeds from the anaheim pepper.  In a large pot, brown ground beed and saute onions, carrots and celery.</li>
    <li>Add spaghetti sauce.  Drain beans and rinse beans and add those.  Add corn and tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Mix everything together and heat till boiling.  My seasoning is more art than science.  I don't use tons of garlic powder.  The others I'm a bit heavy handed with.  Add some, stir and taste.  be careful with the cayenne - a little goes a long way.  Set burner to low, cover the pot and simmer, stirring occasionally.  At least half an hour.</li>
</ol>

<p1>I serve in a bowl and top with the cheese.  Sometimes we used sliced green onion for added flavor.</p1>
